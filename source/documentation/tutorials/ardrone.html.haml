    For a very simple drone demo, we're going to use Cylon to make an ARDrone take off, hover, and land. Before you get started, make sure you have the `cylon-ardrone` module installed.
  
  %p First, we need to load up Cylon.
  :markdown
        :::javascript
        Cylon = require 'cylon'

  %p And now that we have that taken care of, we can define our robot.
  :markdown
        :::javascript
        Cylon = require 'cylon'

        Cylon.robot

  %p Our robot will communicate with an ARDrone over an IP address, and controls the drone using a device we're going to call "drone":
  :markdown
        :::javascript
        Cylon = require 'cylon'

        Cylon.robot
          connection:
            name: 'ardrone', adaptor: 'ardrone', port: '192.168.1.1'

          device:
            name: 'drone', driver: 'ardrone'

  %p The work for this robot is pretty straightforward. It's going to take off, and then land after ten seconds. Five seconds later, after it's safely on the ground, it will fully stop.
  :markdown
        :::javascript
        Cylon = require 'cylon'

        Cylon.robot
          connection:
            name: 'ardrone', adaptor: 'ardrone', port: '192.168.1.1'

          device:
            name: 'drone', driver: 'ardrone'

          work: (my) ->
            my.drone.takeoff()
            after 10.seconds(), ->
              my.drone.land()
            after 15.seconds(), ->
              my.drone.stop()
  
  %p Simple as can be. And now that we've got all that set up, we can get started!
  :markdown
        :::javascript
        Cylon = require 'cylon'

        Cylon.robot
          connection:
            name: 'ardrone', adaptor: 'ardrone', port: '192.168.1.1'

          device:
            name: 'drone', driver: 'ardrone'

          work: (my) ->
            my.drone.takeoff()

            after 10.seconds(), ->
              my.drone.land()

            after 15.seconds(), ->
              my.drone.stop()

        .start()

  %h4 JavaScript example:
  :markdown
        :::javascript
        var Cylon = require('cylon');

        Cylon.robot({
          connection: {name: 'ardrone', adaptor: 'ardrone', port: '192.168.1.1'},
          device: {name: 'drone', driver: 'ardrone'},
          work: function(my) {
            my.drone.takeoff();

            after((10).seconds(), function() {
              my.drone.land();
            }

            after((15).seconds(), function() {
              my.drone.stop();
            }
          }
        }).start();
